# Trading At Market Close

In minute mode `handle_data` is called every minute which is okay when checking for intraday signals, but what if you wanted to execute your code only once and at the end of the trading day? `within_market_close()` is a method that checks if itâ€™s currently at the market close and returns True if it is and False otherwise.

An example use of the method would be if you wanted to order a security at the close price, you would first call `within_market_close()`: e.g. 

```
def handle_data(context,data):
    if (within_market_close(0)):
        order(5000, sid)
```

`within_market_close()` would return `True` at 3:59 PM and the order would be carried out at the next available bar (e.g. 
4:00  PM). It also takes into account early closes such as the Friday after Thanksgiving where the market closes at 1:00 PM.

`within_market_close()` takes in a `minutes_early` integer, which will return True at 3:59 PM - `minutes_early`. 

So the following would return True at 3:54 PM and, if used with an order method, will execute orders at the next available
trading bar (usually the next minute e.g. 3:55 PM)

```
within_market_close(5)
```
